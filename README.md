You are reading the README.md file in the nhis_exploratory repository 
for Russ Robbins on GitHub.

Currently this directory contains the 2014 National Health Interview Survey
data as well as a program I am finishing writing which creates parsers for
 the various *.dat files.

The output of any parser that is built by the program is a CSV file.

There are subdirectories for each of the types of *.dat files.

TODO:

1. Add command line functionality/arguments.
2. Identify number of lines in *.dat file and use.
3. Use try/except/else/finally for more exception handling.
4. Perform unit testing.
5. Document how to use the program.
6. Document requirements for element_names and element positions files.
