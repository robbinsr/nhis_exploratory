You are reading the README.md file in the nhis_exploratory repository 
for Russ Robbins on GitHub.

Currently this directory contains the 2014 National Health Interview Survey
data as well as a program I am finishing writing which creates parsers for
 the various *.dat files.

The output of any parser that is built by the program is a CSV file.

There are subdirectories for each of the types of *.dat files.

TODO:

Make program runnable from command line with command line arguments.
Add argument for dat file length or choose to count lines.
Use try/except/else/finally as appropriate.
Perform unit testing.
Document how to use the program, including:
Requirements for element_names and element positions files.
